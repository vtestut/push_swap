# push_swap

Welcome to my `push_swap` project !  
This project was a challenging task for me in the Ecole 42 curriculum, it requires to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations.  
See the [subject](https://github.com/VirgileT/push_swap/blob/main/SUBJECT_push_swap.pdf)

## Project Overview

The `push_swap` project is an introduction to algorithmic problem-solving and the optimization of sorting algorithms. Key features include:

- **Stack Manipulation:**
  - Implement operations to manipulate two stacks, A and B.

- **Sorting Algorithm:**
  - Develop an efficient sorting algorithm to organize the numbers in stack A.

- **Optimization:**
  - Minimize the number of operations to achieve the sorted state.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files, including the main `push_swap` program.
- **`/include/`:** Header files, including `push_swap.h`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile (`make`).
4. Run the executable with a list of integers as arguments (`./push_swap 4 2 7 1`).

## Additional Tools

- **Checker Program:**
  - Use the `checker` program to verify sorting operations (`./checker 4 2 7 1 | ./push_swap 4 2 7 1`).

Special thanks to Ecole 42 for the inspiration and learning opportunity.

Happy sorting! ðŸš€
